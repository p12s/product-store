# What is going on there
What does the client do:  
- sending address to download products (for example, http://164.92.251.245:8080/api/v1/products/)  
- requesting products with pagination functionality (limit, skip)  
- requesting products continuously, simulate endless loading (based on bidirectional-stream)  
  
What does the server do:  
- going to the url, download and save the csv-file, extract the products from it, save to your database  
- giving products with pagination functionality (limit, skip)  
- giving away products in stream  
  
Services are raised in docker-compose, the client starts and executes requests with output to the console, and then exits.  
The server continues to work  

# Separate services
